# Readable React + Redux :book:

The `Readable` project is a web application for content and comments. The app will allow users to post content in pre-defined categories, comment on their own and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users can edit and delete posts and comments.

## Getting Started :+1:
First we'll clone the project:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/gustafsilva/read-react-nanodegree-project.git
```

Then install and run the backend server:
```shell
$ cd read-react-nanodegree-project/backend/api-server/
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then open another terminal in the project's frontend folder, install and run the application:
```shell
$ cd read-react-nanodegree-project/frontend/
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Ready! Now open your browser at [localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000/) the application will already be running :stars:
